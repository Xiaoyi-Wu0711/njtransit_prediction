## 1. Feature Engineering
According to above analysis, we use the delay of every station on every line in NJ Transit as the dependent variable. Independent variables are temporal, spatial and weather conditions which may influence delay.
Considering the delay propagation effects in transit network, we also create time-lag feature such as `time_lag_3H` and `time_lag_30M` to indicate temporal changes. 

1. Temporal features:
<div id="hv_table_time"></div>
2. Spatial features:
<div id="hv_table_location"></div>
3. Weather features:
<div id="hv_table_weather"></div>
4. Time lag features: 
We consider the line as a system in terms of delays where the delay of one station at one point of the line depends on the delay of other station. Therefore, for every station, we calculate the delay of its corresponding last station's delay 3 hours or 30 minutes ago.

### 2) Correlation matrix 
The following plot shows the correlation between independent variables.

## 2. Model
Here we use the Random Forest as our baseline model and normalize data with `StandardScaler()`. This model takes delay length as the dependent variable and other features as independent variables.
he model used 2019/11 and 2019/12 delay data, and randomly divided them into 7:3 as train dataset and test dataset correspondingly. The train dataset is used to train the model and the test dataset is used to evaluate model fitness and generalization. 
The accuracy in train dataset is about 98.7%, while for the test set, the accuracy is about 74.9%.
When it comes to confusion matrix, we can clearly see that our model have good specificity (44.5%) and high sensitivity(88.2%). 
Considering the train delay can impose high cost in transportation system and personal activity, 
the specificity which indicate the model can predict the delayed train correctly in 44.5% of time and thus has great significance in reality. The sensitivity indicates that the model can predict the non-delayed train correctly in 88.2% of time. Both of them suggest our model has good fitness and generalization.

According to the importance of the features, it indicates that station lag, weather, and stop sequence related variables are the most important features in this model.

## 3. Next Step
Firstly, we can add line lag feature, the delay of the same train (i.e. having identical train IDs) at the same station one day prior, into model.<br>
Secondly, we can wrangle census data and take demographic factors and trip amount into consideration.<br>
Thirdly, BBC (2011), Siddharth (2018), Brad (2020), shared some insight about the potential reasons that impact the train’s punctuality in the UK, India, Japan correspondingly. 
Except for time and spatially related features, main causes such as engineering work (e.g. train inspection or track renewal), technical issues (e.g. signal failure or track fractures) also have an effect on the train’s punctuality. Higgs (2021) also mentioned that breakdown is the top cause of NJ Transit’s cancellation. 
Therefore, we believe that such kinds of maintenance and breakdown notification, for example from an official Twitter account, can be incorporated into this model in the future.we can wrangle twitter data about delay notification from NJ transit official account to collect reasons of train delay.
