## 1. Time
Firstly, we plot the distribution of delays by their duration time. According to figure below, we can clearly see that the delays in NJ transit’s commute rail services is the left-skewed distribution. The bulk of delays (97%）events last from 0 min to 20 min. However, we have to notice there is an extremely long tail in the plots, which reveals that approximately 50 travels (0.016%) are suffering from more than 100 minutes delay

It's known that delay is highly related to date and time, rider's travel behavior and train schedule varied according to weekday, time of the day and holidays. The following diagram plots the train volume by `scheduled arrive time` (the bars), as well as the average delay minutes by `scheduled arrive time` and `the departure weekday` (the series lines). 

It demonstrates that rush hours of NJ transit rail service are mostly around 6am-10am and 3pm-8pm. The series lines indicate that the heavy delay usually happened around 6pm-7:30pm of the day, and considering the train volume, the most severe dealy occurs on **Saturday 8pm-9pm** where trains were delayed for an average of 8 minutes.

However, NJ Transit operates 166 stations in total <a href="https://www.njtransit.com/press-releases/nj-transit-named-one-years-americas-best-employers-forbes">(NJ Transit, 2021)</a>., did the train usually delay in the same pattern for all stations? The answer is no. The subsequent section will analyze the delay by station.


## 2. Weather
Weather is another type of feature that would impact train punctuality by affecting the operation of the rail infrastructure, especially the extreme weather, for example, high winds, ice and snow, etc, <a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/bulletin/weather-and-climate-change-implications-surface-transportation-usa">(McGuirk, 2009)</a>. However, many weather data are not free, let alone the fact that   we need to get more than 400,000 weather data in 2019 by longitude, latitude and date one-time via API. Therefore, we decide to use the free weather station data from <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=GHCND"> National Centers for Environmental Information</a>, which has a variety of historical daily weather conditions.

Another issue of this weather data is that about 15% of records are NA, in order to guarantee the model have enough records, we fill the uncommon weather feature like `fog` and `precipitation` as 0, and fill normal weather condition like `temperature` and `wind` as mean. 

The following series of plots try to visualize the relationship between weather and the percentage of delay greater than 5mins; it indicates that when `fog`, `ice pellets`, `haze` and large `precipitation` occur, the percentage of delay greater than 5mins is higher than under regular weather conditions.
