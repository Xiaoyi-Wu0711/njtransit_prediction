## Inspiration

This project aims to analyze the spatio-temporal distribution of train delay in New Jersey Transit(NJ Transit), and make a binary prediction model to predict if certain train at specific station is going to experience a delay more than 10 minutes.

Covering a service area of 5,325 square miles, NJ Transit is the third-largest statewide public transportation system in the United States, operating bus, light rail, and commuter rail. It also has the nationâ€™s second-largest commuter rail network which has 11 lines, 164 rail stations and serves over 300,000 customers everyday. The commuter rail network are concentrated in northern New Jersey, despite the Atlantic City Line runs between Atlantic City and Philadelphia and is detached from the main network.

However, the rail network has been plagued by chronic delay issues for a long time. According to the data released by Federal Transit Administration, NJ Transit have the most commuter train breakdown in 2018.

Thus, we conduct analysis to reveal factors which influence delay and help the operators provide more punctual services.

At the same time, we develop prediction models to forecast when and where the delay will occur to help the passengers mitigate delay cost.


## Content
The project will be seperated into following 2 sections:
- **Exploratory analysis**: when, where  did the delay usually happen? 
- **Modeling**: methods involving feature engineering, model selection, cross-validation.
